# CapOneCSVParser

I wanted to analyze my Capital One credit card spending in 2019. The CSV file had to be modified so that the functions could successfully parse.

The next updated will include and update to the parsing function so that a normal downloaded CSV file from Capital One can be parsed without any modifications.
